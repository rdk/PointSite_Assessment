#============== Section I: run and assess each coparison method ===================#
#-> define the PointSite_HOME here !!
#   [note]: PointSite_HOME shall contain 'PointSite_Assessment/' and 'PointSite_TestData/'
export PointSite_HOME=~/GitBucket
#-> define the assessment dataset here !!
#   [note]: 0 for assessing 'blind' dataset only, while 1 for all 6 testing datasets.
export Assess_Switch=0


#-------------- Part I: run each method for a given dataset
#bash run_all.sh

#-------------- Part II: run assessment for each method 
bash assess_all.sh

#-------------- Part III: assess PointSite's IoU
bash pointsite_iou.sh

#-------------- Part IV: use PointSite to help each method 
bash pointsite_merge.sh



#============== Section II: installation of each coparison method =================#
#-> 1. p2rank
https://github.com/rdk/p2rank

[note]:
To install p2rank, we need gradle -> https://gradle.org/install/
Also, export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gradle/gradle-5.6.2/bin


#-> 2. fpocket
https://github.com/Discngine/fpocket

[note]:
To install fpocket, we need the molfile plugin from VMD:
sudo apt-get install libnetcdf-dev
or,
sudo yum install netcdf-devel.x86_64


#-> 3. sitehound
http://scbx.mssm.edu/sitehound/sitehound-download/download.html
(NOT open source, highly unrecommended !!)

[note]:
To succesfully run sitehound, we need install A LOT OF 32-bit libraries, such as libX11.so.6 and libSM.so.6 !!!

[procedures]:
In order to install them, please first to install the 64-bit version libraries by the following command:
`sudo yum install libSM libX11`

Then, use yum provides to search for the required 32-bit libraries of those missing files, for example,
`yum provides libX11.so.6`

It shall come with the required libraries as follows:
`libX11-1.6.7-2.el7.i686`

Then, install this library by typing sudo yum install libX11.i686

[bugs]:
It is well known that sitehound will report a bug if the input PDB contains ANY missing atoms which is very common.
Thus, to handle such situations, we have to "reconstruct" the PDB with the following module:
`BuildModel_Package/util/Complete_PDB.sh 5ow0A_xyz.pdb /tmp/5ow0A_xyz.pdb`



#-> 4. selenium
This is the package for command-line based Web Server submission for deepsite and metapocket2
