0. Requirements
The programs have been tested on Linux (Ubuntu distro), Mac OS X and Windows XP
A working Python environment is required to run the scripts that are provided to
automate the calculations.

1. INTRODUCTION

EasyMIFs and SiteHound are meant to be used from the command line (shell
under UNIX and DOS prompt under Windows). Both programs can be used
individually, but a Python script to streamline the process of binding site 
identification is provided, and its use is therefore recommended.

2. INSTALLATION
The suite does not require any special installation procedure. The archive
downloaded from the web must be uncompressed and can then be placed anywhere.

3. BASIC USAGE WITH THE 'auto.py' SCRIPT
The auto.py provided in the root directory of the suite allows the user to
carry out binding site identification using Molecular Interaction Fields in a
streamlined fashion. An example of the most basic use:

auto.py -i PDB.pdb -p CMET

auto.py will automatically prepare the pdb, calculate the Interaction Energy
Map and carry out cluster analysis (the final step of binding site
identification). A short description of all the options that the script
supports can be obtained by calling the script with the usual -h or --help flag.
The options supported by the script are the following:

-i --input	The pdb file
-p --probe	The probe type, either CMET (methyl) or OP (phosphate oxygen)
-k --clean	Remove HETATM from the pdb
-r --resolution	The resolution of the grid in Angstrom (default: 1.0)
-c --center	The center of the grid (default: center of the protein)
-d --dimension	The dimensions of the box (default: whole protein)
-e --energy	(default: -8.9 for CMET, -8.5 for OP)
-l --linkage	Either 'single' or 'average' (default: 'average')
-s --spatial	The spatial cutoff (default: 1.1 for single linkage, 7.8 for average)
-x --pdb2gmx	Print the output of pdb2gmx
-o --log	Send the output messages to a log file
-h --help	Show this help

4. IMPORTANT NOTE
The programs work only on "clean" PDBs, i.e. files that do not have HETATM
records. The user can get rid of HETATM by using the -k or --clean option in
the auto.py script, or manually take care of that. Furthermore, missing atoms
or residues are not allowed.
